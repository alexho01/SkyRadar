This C++ Weather API Client retrieves real-time weather data for any city using the OpenWeather API. It manages API keys securely through environment variables, with manual input as a fallback. The program formats city names for URL compatibility, makes secure HTTPS requests using libcurl, and parses JSON responses via the nlohmann JSON library. It displays clear, user-friendly output including temperature (Â°C), humidity, and descriptive weather conditions. Robust error handling ensures resilience against API failures, parsing errors, and invalid inputs, providing informative feedback and a reliable user experience.
